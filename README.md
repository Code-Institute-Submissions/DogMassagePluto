## Features
I wanted to create a simple and friendly website, with all the information on one page. 

The header is very ordered, easy to read and easy to understand. The menu will lead you to the right part of the website.

The first three sections are informative about the sorts of massage which are giving. They are place in one big section, because they belong together. 

After this section there will be every time first a title followed by the information.
In small size the navbar is collapsible and there are less images for less scrolling and more peace.
