## Mockups & Wireframes
The following wireframes were created using Balsamiq to design the website layout options:

</ul>


## Features
I wanted to create a simple and friendly website, with all the information on one page. 

The header is very ordered, easy to read and easy to understand. The menu will lead you to the right part of the website.

The first three sections are informative about the sorts of massage which are giving. They are place in one big section, because they belong together. 

After this section there will be every time first a title followed by the information.
In small size the navbar is collapsible and there are less images for less scrolling and more peace.

## Testing
This website is a scrollable website with all the information on one page.

The header is responsive to large and small devices. On large devices the title and full menu will be shown, while on small devices the title and a collapsible menu will be shown.

The menu links will are internal links and will lead to the right part on the website. 

The contact form has required attributes which are needed before submitting the form.

In the footer will be found the social media links, which are external links.

The home button, will lead to the top of the website.

On small devices some pictures are gone for a more friendly to use website. There will also appear a collapsible menu with the internal links. Each row will be shown vertical instead of horizontal, form better readability.

Tested multiple browser’s (chrome, safari, internet explorer, firefox) & mobile devices (….)

# Deployment
I started working on this project in Repl.it because I worked on it from different devices. Every time I was on my own laptop I copied everything to GitPod and pushed it to GitHub. Like this I also always had a backup, when needed. 

This website starts with the: index.html, followed by the map ‘assets’, with a map of ‘images’ and a map of ‘css’. In the ’css’ map you will find the page: style.css.
