# Deployment
I started working on this project in Repl.it because I worked on it from different devices. <br>
Every time I was on my own laptop I copied everything to GitPod and pushed it to GitHub. <br>
Like this I also always had an extra backup, when needed. <br>
<br>
This website starts with the: index.html, followed by the map ‘assets’, with a map of ‘images’ and a map of ‘css’. <br>
In the ’css’ map you will find the page: style.css.<br>
A map called 'mockups' with small, medium and large wireframes.<br>
a map called 'screenshots' with an image of the used colors and a demo.gif.<br>
Ending with the README.md.
